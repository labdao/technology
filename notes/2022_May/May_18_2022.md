# LabDAO Tech Team Meeting 18 May 2022

## CLI
* Estuary
    * `file push` and `file pull` use this as a service on the CLI for IPFS pinning
    * Important esp when running compute on remote machines, need to pin entire subdirectories
    * CID is default for locating content
    * Abstraction above CID which provides a virtual filesystem (think user directories for each wallet address)
    * Instead of pushing a single file, we can push entire directories to IPFS (ex. `some_folder/subdirectory/file_a.json`)
    * Articulating namespaces allows us to create public (or private if they're encrypted) datasets
    * Whitelisted providers --> Known datasets
    * Can fetch content using the namespaces via the CLI
    * Eventually, we can append local data to these datasets
    * [Nebulus](https://nebulus.dev/) - "IPFS-less IPFS" useful for staging prior to IPFS pinning, useful playground
* MVP for application developers
    * CLI tests ongoing
    * Application developers won't be able to hook up their apps to the CLI yet. Alpha release will be `revcomp` for now, but iterations for adding new applications should be quick
        * Add application code to template repo
        * Add API endpoint for available apps so we can run applications' code

* orbit db

### Q&A
* stability of https calls? still 
* changes to directories can be in sync with a daemon directories - *cookiecutter data science* integration with makefile possible

## Contracts
* Rename `client` and `provider` in our smart contracts
    * proposal: `user` & `service provider`

linguistic styleguide - lily (will be on docs.labdao)
* `greenlist` instead of `whitelist`
* `client` will be used for the software enabling interaction with the protocol

* Modularizing which blockchain users are operating on. We're developing on Polygon for now, but need submodules for whichever chain we're using (impacts contract addresses, subgraph endpoints, RPC endpoints, etc )

## Graph Team
* Met yesterday, more to come soon :D

## Laboratory services
* ligand detection NMR
    * input
        * small molecule structure 
        * amino acid sequence of protein
    * parameters
    * output

## ML inference
* collaboration with TalentDAO(?)
* more to come
