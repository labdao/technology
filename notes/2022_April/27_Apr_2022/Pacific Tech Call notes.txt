- how to get scientists onto github
- using github for documents-only proposals etc
- need exemplary processes for bringing projects into the openlab ecosystem
    - code design + architecture, testing
    - documentation
    - availability, installation
    - resilience (stays available after other ppl leave)
- need a way to create opportunities + guide contributors
    - create guide post projects
- Rik: "information architecture is the primary thing"
    - need focus group between tech and science group
    - tech group is rapidly developing tons of things, in a non-decentralized way
    - need coherent plan for future, but need to bring everyone with us, scientists need to know what's going on and be involved
    - coordination meeting between the groups
    - Proposals system; how do you dissent, discuss about plans so everyone is involved? (we don't have that)
    - Open Source <> DAO needs to converge before making more advances in the tech side
    - MVP is just to demonstrate vision, but soon after we need processes in place for ppl to participate
    - *** build processes for voting on CLI, none of this is communicated right now

- Data encryption: 
    - Rik: needs to serve encryption, for compliance
    - need a use case first though
    - protocol design should not contain metadata that might need to be encrypted later
        - but does need top level data identifiers
        - need to be able to connect to encrypted data as a second layer ("nested space")

- CLI
    - operational
    - web3 side is operational too
    - the UX for CLI is still being figured out / polished
    - now allowing ppl to contribute to CLI, documentation being built
    - *** Jesse + Aakash figuring out the CLI and writing down documentation; what does it look like + feel like, into the "final product"
    - "ready soon"
    - ppl can just fire off a command; the Vercel CLI of bioinformatics


- how to get people to contribute?
    - "green-lit pipelines"
    - AlphaFold, RNAseq implemented and well-documented
        - RNAseq illumina aligning short reads

- Preregistration closed alpha
    - get Alpha ppl onboarded; they know what's going on
    - Initially 10 ppl

- metadata
    - compatibility with biodata, opensea
    - what else in the future; reverse engineer biocompute data
    - IPFS metadata should be a "go to IPFS to find the data" not the data itself
    - minimum set of top-level keys

- github repo to archive notes from
    - hackmd, discord
    - notion isn't an archiving solution (can't back them up)
